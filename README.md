Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data
_Basic Udacity project using pandas library in Python for their bikeshare data exploration._

# Project Overview:

This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform a rudimentary analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Running the program:

You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program.

### Program Details:

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

# Requirements:

* Language: Python 3.7 or above
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

# Project Data:

* chicago.csv - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

* new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

* washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

# Built with:

* [Python 3.9.6](https://www.python.org/) - The language used to develop this.
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - One of the libraries used for this.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - One of the libraries used for this.
* [time](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) - One of the libraries used for this.

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

Data for the first 10 rides in the new_york_city.csv file

#Comments: 
Was challengeing but overall experience was fairly easy to understand
